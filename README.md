# AI-Based Decision Support System for Drug Recommendation

This repository contains a **Decision Support System (DSS)** designed to provide **drug recommendations** based on patient-reported conditions.  
The project implements a simple **chatbot interface** in Python and utilizes a structured dataset of medical conditions and drug information.
